# Inventory Manager

## Note

In order to focus fully on my new coursework at V School, I set this project aside for a time. I plan to complete it after my graduation from V School. Although it is incomplete, I am highlighting it here because it demonstrates valuable learning.

## Objective

Build a front-end CRUD inventory manager application with AngularJS. Include user authentication (sign-up/login), permissions (admin/registered user/unregistered user), a fully functional shopping cart, order placement and history, and the ability to add, remove, and update inventory.

## Challenges and Insights

This was the first project I built using AngularJS, and I faced a steep learning curve throughout the project. Concepts such as two-way binding, dependency injection, singleton services, and the model-view-controller pattern were new to me and difficult to wrap my head around. The most challenging task for me was dealing with resolves. The syntax was straightforward, but I struggled to know when and why to use them, and accidently wrote conflicting resolves a few times. There were many points during the project when I felt discouraged and ready to give up. It became clear to me that the only way out was through, and that instead of backing off and letting go, leaning into the difficulty and pushing through it was good for me and would result in a deeper understanding of the concepts than I could have gotten through a lecture or tutorial. I'm looking forward to jumping back into this project and seeing it to completion. 

## Future Plans

Add the following features:
* Order History
* Transaction Details
* Admin Dashboard (transaction histories, inventory management)
